> API
This module is for all interactions with external APIs.
This project uses two APIs for box art scraping: the Twitch API and the 
IGDB API.
The Twitch API is used for authentication purposes, as you can only access the
IGDB API through a Twitch client.

This is a placeholder file allowing for imports from the API folder.
